Spirograph figures in Python... just for fun! :-)

This Ï€ symbol is drawn by 2302 rotating circles.

But we can reduce frequency (at the the cost of losing some accuracy).

This person you might recognize was drawn with just 780 rotating circles.

## How it Works

The project uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to decompose 2D paths into their frequency components, where each
component represents a rotating circle (epicycle) that contributes to recreating the original shape.
